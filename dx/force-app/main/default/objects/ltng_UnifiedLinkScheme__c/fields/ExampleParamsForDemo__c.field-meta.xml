    <description>It is understood that this will only be used during demos, 
but by adding this field to the object, it gives much more flexibility 
for people playing around / giving the demo than using custom metadata/custom settings. 

(As some reference salesforce ids, and must be generated after data loads 
this avoids the needs for complex dependent deployments, etc.)</description>
